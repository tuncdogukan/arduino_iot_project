# arduino_iot_project
This is the bulk of the code which I used in my master's finishing project.
It's basically an IoT project, in which there are several Arduino Uno/Nano boards, connected to a sensor of different type.
The main idea is to provide a Wireless communication between these "Nodes", whenever an event like Fire, Flood, Gas Leak etc. occurs.
The central node will display a message on the LCD display and also sound alarms with the buzzer, according to the nature of the event.
